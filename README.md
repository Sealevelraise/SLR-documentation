## About the project
* * *
The project is part of the module _M3 Methods and Tools in BUI Projects_ in WiSe 2022/2023 of the Master's program BUI at HTW Berlin.

Sea Level Raise (SLR) is a donation platform for projects in so-called Small States, states with a small population and a small land area that are particularly affected by climate change.
Due to their low importance in the global country ranking, these states have so far had a problem being heard.

Through the Web3 project "Sea Level Raise" this problem is addressed, these are our three principles:

* __Fair Participation:__ SLR wants the voices of Small States to be heard. Through SLR, small states can make visible the consequences threatening their existence due to climate change and present their own proposals for solutions.

* __Fair funding:__ SLR wants to ensure that smaller projects can also be funded and that projects from Small States are also considered. Furthermore, SLR as a participatory distribution mechanism is attractive for donations from different sources, because e.g. companies can support climate projects without individuals having to fear that they have too much decision-making power.

* __Fair distribution:__ By organizing SLR as a DAO, fair distribution mechanisms will be established so that each donor can have a say in how their money is used.


## About us
